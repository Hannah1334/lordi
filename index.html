<h1>Detailed Information</h1>
<b>Humanoid Appearance</b><br>
<i>Height/Weight</i>: The entity known as Lord I stands at 6'7" and weighs near 160 lbs. It is hard to distinguish his gender (when clothed) because despite being very muscular, he is extremely feminine in shape, and is often mistaken for a woman with a flat chest. When separated, Haerviu stands at 6'5" and weighs near 175 lbs. while his Eternal Mate, Feidlimid, is exactly 6'0" and weighs about 150 lbs. Haerviu is very masculine and heavily built with obvious firm muscle stretching out his flesh but still managing to retain a thin and lithe shape. Feidlimid also is very thinly built, but is also very shapely with wide child-bearing hips and a very prominent bust and rear.
<br>
<i>Hair/Facial</i>: Lord I has very long black hair that reaches all the way to his waist, but manages to remain strictly straight no matter the weather. His face has sharp foundations, such as high cheekbones, a strong prominent jaw, and even a jutting chin, and yet he somehow manages to look soft and gentle. Likely to do with the very feminine appearance his face has--the crystalline quality of his bright blue eyes don't help--even his voice is somewhere between male and female. It is incredibly hard to distinguish which gender he belongs to. Haerviu on his own has a very angular face with features that are almost too defined, and the intense glow of his amber eyes seem almost naturally aggressive. He also has black hair, but it is much shorter, the longest tips barely brushing against his cheeks. Feidlimid has long hair much like Lord I, but hers is white and sometimes curls in humid or damp weather. Her face is very gentle and soft with rounded cheeks, full lips, and large kind eyes that are the same soft blue as Lord I's.
<br>
<i>Animalistic Attributes</i>: O'Damas are not like their bretheren when it comes to their fox-give-aways on their humanistic bodies. They have needle-teeth no matter what form they take, and very interesting fox ears that sit atop their heads. Some speculate that they look more like crystallized transluscent horns but they are actually soft to the touch and move just like the ears of any other animal. O'Damas do not have "tails" unless they have undergone a huge trial of honor and are rewarded with one. Lord I's ear and tail growths are a deep black, as are Haerviu's, but while in direct bright lighting Lord I's growths give off a dark blue tint, his have a dark gold quality to them. Feidlimid, on the other hand, has completely clear white growths, regardless of lighting.
<br><br>
<b>True Form Appearance</b><br>
<i>Height/Weight</i>: Lord I stands at nearly 23 hh, but weighs about as much as a feather. This is because Kitsunes are a spiritual presence and have "tangible" bodies made of spiritual essences (this essence varies for each individual.) While the weight remains true for the individual forms, Haerviu stands at 20.5 hands, and his mate is roughly 20.2.
<br>
<i>Fur/Body</i>: Lord I's "fur" takes on a crystal appearance, exactly like the crystallized horns atop his head in his humanoid form (this is true for Haerviu and Feidlimid as well), but his eyes keep their bright blue glow (as does Feidlimid, while Haerviu's eyes remain their usual gold). While muscular, his body is still very thin and lithe, allowing him to stay agile and flexible. This is also true for both the mates in their individual forms, Lord I and Haerviu with black "fur" while Feidlimid's is a clear white.
<br>
<i>Distinguishing Features</i>: Rune-like markings cover his body and constantly glow a bright blue (blue for Feidlimid as well, but gold for Haerviu). These runes are an ancient language that mark his identity (such as his name and his titles) but the knowledge of what they say will not be passed down until he has "earned his tail." (These runes are not magical spells, only words in a lost language, purely aesthetic.)
<br><br>
<b>Personality</b><br>
Haerviu and Feidlimid are vastly different in their behavior, but still not entirely what they seem. As aggressive and macho-male as Haerviu appears, he is actually quite docile--almost lazy even--and actively looks for ways around violence. Considered to be rather sly, and charismatic, he's rather easy-going and easy to get along with. Feidlimid is also a kind soul, but is easily led to feel responsibility for things that shouldn't even pertain to her--and therefore is also easily led to feel guilt. At her core, she has good intentions, and is the epitome of the "motherly" stereotype, caring deeply for her husband and her children. While usually as slow to violence as her mate, all of her morals and personal beliefs will be dropped if it is clear her family is in life threatening danger. Lord I is a balance between both personalities; fiercly loyal, but very relaxed and almost carefree. He retains a special bias when it comes to the safety of his family, but does not jump to conclusions. He is essentially the best of both of them.

<h1>Racial Abilities of the Mighty O'Dama</h1>
<p align="center"><img style="width:30%;" src="https://i.imgur.com/XoqpnCq.jpg"/> <img style="width:30%;" src="https://i.imgur.com/KneCtX6.png"/> <img style="width:30%;" src="https://i.imgur.com/LQvSj2u.jpg"/></p>
<b>The Shift</b><br>
A racial ability that allows the O'Damas to change between their humanoid and true bodies with ease. Since they are technically spirits with synthetic bodies the process is very easy, despite the size difference.
<br><br>
<b>Great Strength</b><br>
Every O'Dama has twice the strength of the typical human being.
<br><br>
<b>Great Speed</b><br>
Likewise, each O'Dama is not only gifted with twice the speed of the typical human, but also twice the reaction time. Cinnia has done much to train and hone this ability, and she has grown beyond "twice" to "thrice." (Meaning she has x3 instead of the typical x2)
<br><br>
<b>Enhanced Balance</b><br>
When an O'Dama earns its tail, they have a very deep and thorough control over the balance of either form.
<br><br>
<b>Sound and Smell</b><br>
The noses and ears of an O'Dama are very sensitive, twice as sensitive as that of a typical humans. While it is a great strength for tracking and hunting, it is also a devastating weakness to overpowering scents and incredibly loud noises.
<br><br>
<b>Tears of a Jewel</b><br>
O'Damas have a very well trained sense of control over their emotions, and it is very difficult to make them cry from true sorrow. Should their tears be triggered by emotions that run deep enough, they leak a strange liquid that has incredible toxin-cleansing effects (can cleanse any natural nonmagic poison/venom/toxin). If given enough time, the tears can be hardened into a beautiful jewel-like substance as tough as iron. When the O'Damas achieve the feat of growing beyond the rank of High Mage, the cleansing effects and toughness of their tears increase. They gain the ability to cleanse basic magical toxins (of up to Mage rank) and are as tough as steel when hardened, rather than iron.
<br><br>
<b>Tails of a Fox</b><br>
Rather than gain multiple ones like a "Kitsune," O'Damas have no tail until they realize and accept the purpose and path laid out for them by their gods. Once they gain their tail, they become recognized as adults among their own people. While long, flexible, and as soft as any other animal's tail, these ones appear jagged like cut gems. The strange hornlike growths that stick out of their heads appear the same and feel the same, and are in fact ears. Despite their tough appearance, these aforementioned appendages are very flexible.
<br><br>
<b>Age</b><br>
While the Matriarch and Patriarch were made into their fully developed age, their children were born naturally from their bodies. These children grow very slowly, it takes hundreds of years for one to mature, but once their body has fully developed time stops aging it completely. They are still more than capable of dying from natural causes, all natural causes aside from old age.
<br><br>
<b>The Bond</b><br>
The attachment between body and soul that is made when an O'Dama consummates their union with their chosen mate. When an O'Dama sleeps with their partner for the first time, they cause soul ties between themselves and that person, allowing them to feel their partner's emotions and pain as if it were their own. This also allows them to achieve a fused state between themselves and their partner, allowing both to literally become one whole new body, a combination of the two physical appearances. If an O'Dama's mate is not an O'Dama, when they are fused they may access a True Body as if they were one themselves. While The Bond is always passively active, O'Damas and their mates must give up a lot of their strength to go through the fusion process, often leaving them in a very weakened and temporary coma-like state when they do separate back into their own individual bodies.
<br>
<i>Special Note:</i> Lord I is an active fusion, Haerviu and Feidlimid are constantly in The Bond so they may form him. It has been revealed that, while active in this state, ranks and trees of the individuals are <i>all</i> accessible to the fused form, as well as personal items such as specialized Mediums, artifacts, enchanted equipment, etc.

<p align="center"><b>Him</b></p><br>
<h1>High Auror; Deception</h1>
<i>"While a false magician may play with smoke and mirrors to dazzle mortals, mages have a much more precise sense of awareness. Therefore, Deception mages take the next step and make their illusions reality. Deception mages use any manner of tricks and illusions to confuse, dazzle, or even torture their opponents. These tricksters rely solely on humble illusions at lower ranks, but may develop into such things as creating clones of themselves, or even mind control to a small extent."</i>
<br><br>
<h1>Expert Mage; Radiance: Umbrakinesis</h1>
<i>"Users of Radiance must choose between the ultimate duality; to manipulate the light itself, or manifest their power through the darkness of shadows. Dark Radiance, also known as Umbrakinesis, focuses more on creating solid shadows and manipulating the darkness itself to ones advantage. Umbrakinetic mages, who unlock Darkness Energy at Expert mage, a power that allows them to destroy mana within a target creature who becomes exposed to it's negative properties. The Radiance trees can be influenced in a number of ways to provide a boon or nerf to its magic, such as bright days increasing the power of Photokinetics, and Dark nights increasing the power of Umbrakinetics. It is said that evil intent bolsters the strength of an Umbrakinetic mage, and pure devotion does the same for Photokinetics, but it has yet to be proved. Perhaps they are just common tools of Holy Warriors and Dark Beasts."</i>
<br><br>
<h1>Mage; Forcient: Kinetics</h1>
<i>"Forcient is a tree which focuses on the physical constants and laws of the universe, and how one may manipulate these constants and laws to suit their agenda. Forcient is divided into three different branches, each of which controls a small array of forces. A Kinetics mage focuses primarily on the forces of movement; the manipulation of kinetic and potential energy are their specialty. However, many mages may find they have gained access to the manipulation of pressure, and other forces outside of gravity and magnetism. A Kinetics mage's magic is very special- while it is magic, their spells often inflict physical damage."</i>
<br><br>
<p align="center"><b>Her</b></p><br>
<h1>High Auror; Faith</h1>
<i>"Faith mages are a completely support-oriented group of mages. Those who practice Faith hold the ability to mend wounds, lift curses and illnesses, bestow temporary magical boons to their allies, or create Holy Equipment which provide a permanent boon. Faith mages are also highly skilled in defensive arts, and are capable of erecting magical barriers. However, faith mana is completely non hostile, and no faith spell can ever cause harm to another being (unless faith magic specifically harms them). "</i>
<br><br>
<h1>Expert Mage; Magus Manatism</h1>
<i>"The epitome of mana manipulation. Those that take this tree end up taking their skills in this art to levels so ridiculous they can solidify their mana into all shapes and sizes. Manatists start off with an advanced form of mana manipulation that makes them just a bit more adept at Paige rank with their skill than others. This of course doesn't stop being a fact as they rank up and as they learn spells, but lose their edge as their peers get more experienced. With their inate ability at mana manipulation, they are able to learn universal spells that are meant for those a rank above them and below.  Without a question of a doubt, their trump card comes in the form of an advanced form of mana, the purest a mage could possibly make. Arcane energy is a very volatile and destructive force, one that takes much time to master but is fully worth the journey from Expert Mage to the upper ranks available to mages. Some even say its power cannot be matched at its zenith."</i>

<h1>Birth of Deception's Guardians</h1>
Long ago, when man's age was just beginning and he stretched his people out across many realities, there began a great war. Superhuman creatures were birthed for the purpose of making unstoppable warriors, and sent to either slaughter or enslave mankind. Despite the efforts of their gods to create their own beings that would counter the superhumans, it became clear that humanity needed a way to fend for itself. Their gods worked together, hand in hand, to imbue their powers into small seeds and plant them in various places across the realities occupied by humans. These trees grew big and strong, and connected the human worlds to the magical mysticism of the realm the gods existed upon. It allowed them access to magical crafts, which aided them in protecting themselves from their enemies and surviving what would have been a massacre.
<br><br>
When peace finally came, many years of tranquility passed. Humans worshipped the gods and the trees, setting up entire civilizations around the bases of the mystical plants. These civilizations centered around what kind of magic each different tree produced, and whole cultures were influenced from them. The longer the humans stayed on the top of the food chain, pampered by the powers of the Sunborn and Moonborn gods, the more arrogant and ignorant they became. They quickly grew in greed and took their gifts for granted, breaking basic laws of nature implemented with each magic tree's use that was set for the sake of keeping balance. Brother turned on brother, and the worlds were painted red with the blood of betrayal.
<br><br>
The humans were ordered to leave the sacred grounds the trees occupied, but they would not go, so the two gods used their powers once more and began taking the very sap, seeds, and fruits from each magical tree, and created entire races from them. These races were powerful embodiments of each kind of magic, and were more than capable of driving the settlements away. From then on, despite their squabbles with mankind and various wars, these beings were tasked with guarding the tree that gave birth to them.
<br><br>
One of these trees produced an art known as Deception. It was planted deep in the forests of Ireland, and from its roots a pair of fox inspired spirits were formed. While their natural forms were massive canines, they possessed the ability to take more humanistic bodies allowing them to mingle with mankind should peace between the races become an option. Known simply as the O'Damas, their Matriarch and Patriarch march only to the promise of peace, and dream of a world where everyone lived equally...in harmony...in perfect balance.
</div>

<div id="tab5">
<h1>Cultural Practices of the O'Dama Family</h1>
<b>Hierarchy</b><br>
The very first O'Damas made by the hands of the gods themselves from pieces of the Deception Tree reign as equal heads of their own household. They are husband and wife, eternal mates, with six children. The children rank from natural order of their birth, so the second in command is their eldest daughter; Cinnia, or, II. Should anything happen to the parents, II would take their place, and should anything happen to II, III would take her place. It goes on and on down the line just like that.
<br><br>
<b>Equality</b><br>
Males and Females are seen as equals to them, there is no gender based favoritism. Despite the different roles males and females have in the reproduction process, unless a female is pregnant her gender is disregarded as an unimportance.
<br><br>
<b>Marriage and Mating</b><br>
The O'Damas are not sexual creatures, they do not lust and they find no attraction through mere physical means. A well toned body would barely catch their attention, a pretty face wouldn't turn a single head. When an O'Dama mates, or sleeps with their chosen romantic partner, they create The Bond (see racials) between themselves and said partner, tying the two to one another eternally. This does not allow them to ever take on more than one mate, even if their current mate dies, they are stuck to that one soul for eternity. Because of this, they take marriage very seriously. An O'Dama is never promiscuous, unless they are in the company of an already chosen life partner.
<br><br>
<b>Kitsunes and Nekos</b><br>
Since they bear similar body parts to the very common human/animal hybrids, they are often mistaken as one of these creatures. In actuality, O'Damas find the overly sexualized species of Kitsunes and Nekos to be insults to their own image, and are very hateful toward them. O'Damas cannot stand the presence of these creatures and will often try to destroy them.

<h1>Close Family Friends</h1>
Both the Matriarch and Patriarch of this proud clan have long since acknowledged that making friends is far more beneficial than making enemies. They are generally open to forming alliances, those most notable--and closest to their hearts--have found a space here.
